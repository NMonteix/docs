# Search for items, metadata, notes, or tags.

To search across all metadata and notes, click in the search box at the top of the item table. Type in your search term. Your results will appear in the item table.

To clear your search, delete your search term from the search box.

#### Search tips

* When searching for a term that includes an apostrophe or other punctuation, enclose your search term in quotation marks, e.g., _"O'Brien,"_ not _O'Brien_.
* To search for an item that includes multiple search terms, use AND between your search terms, e.g., _Cathcart AND Eaton._
