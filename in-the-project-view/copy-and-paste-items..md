# Copy and paste items.

You can copy an item from a project and paste it again into either the same project or another project on your computer. \(For moving items between projects on different machines, we recommend the [Archive plugin](../other-features/export-with-archive-plugin.md).\)

To copy, select your item and press Ctrl/Cmd + C on your keyboard.

To paste that item, make sure your item table is active and then press Ctrl/Cmd + V on your keyboard.
