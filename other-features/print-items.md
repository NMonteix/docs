# Print items

Tropy allows you to print out your items and their metadata using a standard print dialog box.

To print, select the item or items you wish to print. \(To select multiple items, press Ctrl + click each item you wish to select.\) Then navigate to _File_ &gt; _Print_. You can also press Ctrl+P to see the print dialog box. The print dialog box gives you many options for formatting and layout. Select the format you want and click _Print_.

Tropy's preferences give you options for what parts of your items you wish to print. To change these preferences, go to _Preferences_ and scroll down to _Print_. In that panel you can select whether to print with notes, with metadata, and with photos.
