# Collaboration

Synchronous collaboration with other scholars or across computers is not currently supported, but we are working hard to develop a system for asynchronous collaboration. 

You can save a Tropy project anywhere, on your hard drive, on an external drive, on a cloud drive. If you want others to be able to access the project and use it, you may need to set up a portable project \(read how to do that [here](https://forums.tropy.org/t/testing-portable-project-files/1003)\).

#### Read-only mode

If you are working with a project team, and the research is complete, you may want to make your project read-only so that you or your collaborators don't accidentally change things in your project unexpectedly. Tropy now supports read-only projects.
