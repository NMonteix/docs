# Export from Tropy

Tropy items can be exported as [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), as well as to [Omeka S](http://omeka.org/s/).

## To JSON-LD

To export from Tropy, right-click on an item in the item table. From the right-click menu, select _Export Item &gt; JSON-LD_. This action will open a dialog box, where you can save your JSON file onto your computer. To export multiple items, Ctrl/Command+click or Shift+click to select multiple items. Then right-click and select _Export Selected Items_.

At present, Tropy only exports metadata and notes to JSON-LD, not associated photos. Your photos still exist outside Tropy as well, since importing in Tropy copies your photos.

You can export your notes in either HTML or Markdown. To change which format you wish to use, navigate to _Preferences_ and scroll down to _Export_. Select either "Notes as HTML" or "Notes as Markdown."

## [To Omeka S](omeka.md) <a id="omeka"></a>

Export to Omeka S occurs through the Omeka plugin. In order to use it, you will need an existing Omeka S installation and access to the API information.
